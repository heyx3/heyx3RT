# Heyx3RT

A Ray-tracing library that provides four ways of interacting with it:

1. The actual C++ classes, exported in a DLL
2. A C API, also in the DLL
3. A command-line program
4. An extension to the Unity3D game engine's editor (used entirely in the editor, not in standalone builds!).

I'll expand on this readme soon.
